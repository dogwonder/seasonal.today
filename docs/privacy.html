                        <li>you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example, you might consent to us sending you our newsletter); or</li>
                        <li>we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).</p>
                    <p>We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p>
                    <h3>3. Collection and use of information</h3>
                    <p>We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to contact and communicate with you; and</li>
                        <li>for internal record keeping and administrative purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>4. Disclosure of personal information to third parties</h3>
                    <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
